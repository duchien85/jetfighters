1. Lower number of duplicated loops (foreach meteor, foreach jet....)
2. Create components that control objects vision (can't leave screen border, removed if leaves screen borders etc.)
3. If your jet is hit, notice server so it can remove you from a memory
4. Create random and different textures so multiple players can differ one from another
